# Disaster Social Media Dashboard
This repository contains a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to monitor and analyze simulated social media posts related to disaster events in real-time. The application provides a live feed of incoming posts with filtering capabilities and an analytics dashboard for summarized insights.
# Project Description
In a real-world scenario, this application would serve as a critical tool for emergency responders and organizations, providing immediate situational awareness during natural disasters or crises. By continuously monitoring and analyzing social media posts in real-time, the system automatically categorizes incoming information by problem type—such as fire, flood, power outages, or medical emergencies—and assigns a priority level from low to critical. This allows users to quickly identify urgent situations via the "Live Feed," which displays a dynamic stream of filtered posts, or gain a comprehensive overview of evolving events through the "Analytics" page, offering summarized statistics to inform rapid and effective disaster response efforts.
# Features
Real-time Live Feed: Displays a continuous stream of simulated social media posts as they are generated by the backend server.
Post Filtering: Filter posts on the Live Feed by specific "Problem Types" (Fire, Flood, Power, Medical) and "Priority Levels" (Low, Medium, High, Critical) using interactive checkboxes.
Live Analytics Dashboard: Provides a dynamic table summarizing the total counts of posts by problem type and priority level, updating in real-time.
Single Page Application (SPA): Seamless navigation between Home, Live Feed, and Analytics pages without full page reloads.
Centralized State Management: Utilizes Vuex to efficiently manage and share application data across components.
Responsive UI: Designed with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and adaptive user interface.
# Technologies Used
Frontend:
Vue.js 3 (Framework)
Vue Router 4 (SPA Navigation)
Vuex 4 (State Management)
Socket.IO Client (Real-time communication)
Tailwind CSS (Utility-first CSS framework)
@vue/cli-service (Vue CLI Development Server & Build Tool)
Backend (Data Simulation):
Node.js (Runtime Environment)
Express.js (Web Framework)
Socket.IO (Real-time communication)
cors (CORS Middleware for Express)
lorem-ipsum & random-name (For generating mock data)
# Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)
Installation Steps
Clone the repository or unzip the starter code:
# If you have it in a Git repository
  git clone "your-repo-url"
  
  cd "your-repo-name"
# If you received a zip file (e.g., starter_as6.zip)
Unzip the file to your desired directory
  cd path/to/your/unzipped/project
Install Backend and Frontend Dependencies:
Navigate to the root directory of the project (where package.json is located) and run:
npm install
This will install all necessary packages for both the backend (express, socket.io, etc.) and the frontend (vue, vue-router, vuex, socket.io-client, @vue/cli-service, etc.).
# Running the Application
The application consists of two separate processes: a backend data server and a frontend Vue.js development server. Both need to be running simultaneously.
Start the Backend Data Server:
Open your first terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the project root, and run:
	node server.js
You should see a message indicating the server is listening on http://localhost:3000. Keep this terminal window open.
Start the Frontend Development Server:
Open a second terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the project root, and run:
	npm run serve
This will compile your Vue application and start a development server. You will typically see a message indicating the application is available at http://localhost:8080/. Keep this terminal window open.
# Usage
Once both servers are running:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/.
You will land on the Home Page, which provides an overview of the application.
Use the navigation links at the top to switch between:
Live Feed: See real-time social media posts and use the checkboxes to filter by problem type and priority.
Analytics: View a live-updating summary table of post counts categorized by problem and priority.
